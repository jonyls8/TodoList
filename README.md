# Todolist

This was my first Js project, I wanted to do something useful for myself. Each morning I organize my day to be productive, planning the targets I want to achieve in 
the next 24H, I thought that a Todolist could help me at the same time I keep improving my knowledges.

On this project I introduce some of the basics of Js such a:

- If/else
- Switch
- Functions
- EventListener
- LocalStorage
- and things of the ECMAScript 2015 like "Let"

The main thing about the project was learning Js, letting Html/Css aside (because I think I alredy know how to use it)
